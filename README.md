## Sample Projects
### Neural Network to Recognize Handwritten Numbers
- I built this project in collaboration with a classmate, inspired by a Neural Networks workshop hosted by Google Developer Student Clubs. Building off the base code from the workshop, we built a neural network that does not utilize any ML libraries and that can accept a hand-drawn number and predict what number is depicted. We also remade this project using TensorFlow to test the accuracy and process.
- **Tech Stack:** Python (TensorFlow, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, pickle, streamlit, pillow)
